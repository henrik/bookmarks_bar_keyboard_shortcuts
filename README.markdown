# Chrome extension: Bookmarks Bar Keyboard Shortcuts


**NOTE: This repo is no longer being maintained. Sorry! See if there's a more active fork.**


Chrome/Chromium extension.

Trigger the first ten Bookmarks Bar items with Ctrl+1 through Ctrl+0 (on OS X; it's Alt on Windows, Meta on Linux).

Developed against Chromium 4.0.267.0 on OS X.


## TODO:

* Show number in bookmarks bar when holding modifier?
* Configurable modifier?
* Support opening in new tab? In foreground or background?
* Support more than 10 items?
